## normal mode
This is the main mode from where you can interact with the editor.
It's probably where you'll be most of the time.
From here you can enter any other mode and it's where other modes normally get back to.
It's also from where you do most of code navigation and seleciton manipulation.

## command mode
Perform actions not directly related to editing such as: open/save/close buffer, change settings, execute external programs, etc.
In order to enter command mode, type `:` while in normal mode.

When the input is empty, you can navigate through history with `<c-n>` and `<c-p>`.

**NOTE**: if a command starts with a space, it will not be recorded to the command history.

Also, `<c-n>` and `<c-p>` will choose from the autocomplete entries.

See the [command reference](command_reference.md).
