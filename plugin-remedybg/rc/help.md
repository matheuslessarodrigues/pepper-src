## commands

### `remedybg-spawn`
Spawns a RemedyBG instance opening `<session>` file. If `<session>` is empty, it defaults to `session.rdbg`.
- usage: `remedybg-spawn [<session>]`

### `remedybg-sync-breakpoints`
Syncs all pepper breakpoints to RemedyBG.
Note that generally this is not needed to be called manually as pepper already syncs breakpoints when it idles.
- usage: `remedybg-sync-breakpoints`
